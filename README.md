# MUSA Capstone Project on Dockless Micromobility

(better title to come, with any luck)

`/raw_data/` contains Capital Bikeshare trip history data for December 2021, the most recent available as of 2022-01-27. Data contains trip ID, bicycle type, start and end time, start and end docking station (if applicable), start and end coordinates (inexact for dockless trips), and the rider type (member or casual). For the final project I will want to look at more than one month, but starting with this for initial exploration.

`/notebooks/` contains, at the moment, one small and unpolished Jupyter Notebook with some _very_ preliminary exploratory analysis. I'll expand on this for the next assignment, and will probably keep most of the exploratory work in notebooks to later refine into final Python scripts.
